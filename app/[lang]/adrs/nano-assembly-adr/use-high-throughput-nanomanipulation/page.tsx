                    Current tools like atomic force microscopes (AFM) can move single atoms, but they're slow and limited to surfaces.

                    - High-Throughput Nanomanipulation: Create parallel, automated systems for manipulating trillions of atoms simultaneously. Breakthrough: Scalable arrays of nanoscale probes (e.g., enhanced STM or AFM tips) that operate in 3D environments, not just 2D, with feedback loops for real-time correction. This would allow building volumetric structures like rocket tanks.
